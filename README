This is a classic CRUD application, backed by a JDBC database. It demonstrates:

- Accessing a JDBC database, using Ebean.
- Achieving, table pagination and CRUD forms.
- Integrating with a CSS framework (Twitter Bootstrap ).

Twitter Bootstrap requires a different form layout to the default one that the Play form helper generates, so this application also provides an example of integrating a custom form input constructor.
